# Technical Skills
**SQL, Excel, Python, PowerBI, Snowflake**


# Data Positions
* December, 2021 - today: **Data Management** in Telecom Industry at Cable4 GmbH, Karlsruhe


* November, 2018 - May, 2019: **Junior Social Scientist** in Energy Research at Institute for Ressource Efficiency and Energy Strategies (IREES), Karlsruhe


# Internships
* June, 2018 - October, 2018: Social Science in Energy Research at Institute for Ressource Efficiency and Energy Strategies (IREES), Karlsruhe

* April, 2017 - May, 2018: Social Science and thesis in Energy Research at Fraunhofer Institute for Systems and Innovation Research (ISI), Karlsruhe


# Working Experience
## Projects in my current position

* Currently creating dashbords with PowerBI about customer data and residential assets.
To reach this goal I extracted and transformed data with SQL in Snowflake and connected Snowflake with PowerBI to update the data daily. I use DAX to create measures to display KPIs and to show trends on a quartely basis.

* Call Analysis and Dashboard with Python and Excel. To reached this goal, csv files were monthly loaded, joined and transformed in Python. With Excel Power Query I loaded the data and then plotted them with a Dashboard.

## Previous projects

* Exploratory Analysis about the German commercial building stock using SPSS. The analysis covered technical and energy related data. The dataset originated from a survey conducted by the Fraunhofer Institute.

* Exploratory and inference analysis with SPSS and Excel about the acceptance and attitudes toward as well as requirements of multimodal mobility platforms. This survey was conducted during my study. Theoretical background was 'Diffusion of Innovation' from which the adapter categories were used for clustering.     



# Education
* April, 2023 - today: Career Path **"Data Scientist: Machine Learning Specialist"** on [www.codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-science)

* October, 2014 - April, 2018: **B.Sc. Economic Psychology** at University at Applied Science, Darmstadt  
Thesis: Qualitative study about the acceptance of PV-Systems among german companys.

# Additional Qualification
* Certified Project Management Associate (IPMA Level D)

# My Story and Motivation

When I studied Economic Psychology, quantitative methods played a crucial role in the curriculum. I was exited about gaining insights with data. And somehow I had a sense of handling data. In my 5th semester we conducted a quantitative field study among carsharer about multimodal mobility platforms with the Fraunhofer Institute for System and Innovation Research. And this was my start in Energy Research. I wrote my thesis at Fraunhofer, then worked as a trainee at the Institute for Ressource Efficiency and Energy Strategies and lastly started there as a Junior Social Scientist. Up to this point my work mainly focused on qualitative research. Interviews, Focus Groups, transcribing, analyzing, writing and project meetings were my daily work. But I also did exploratory data analysis, mainly with SPSS and Excel.

When I jumped into the Telecom Industry I quickly realised that handling data require different skills. And there´s a simple reason for that. The data is alive. During my research I worked with static data derived from surveys. But now I have to work with dynamic data that changes daily. I started learning SQL and how to work with PowerQuery in Excel for loading, transforming and joining data. I also learned how to work with new formulas like XLOOKUP - which is still by far the most important and most used formular in Excel for me. Additionally, I began learning "R" for extracting and transforming data via API. When Snowflake was introduced, my knowledge in SQL came into play. Furthermore i had to familiarize myself with PowerBI, which was also introduced for reporting data. So, there was a lot to learn, and i´m still learning these tools today.

But there is still a missing piece in my data knowledge. Up to this point i did a lot of exploratory data analysis or said differently, so far i work with data which represent the past. But I´m also exited to predict the future with data. Because of my study I was already familiar with models like regression or factor analysis etc. But everything in a straight scientific way. To minimize this gap I decided to start with Machine Learning and signed up on [codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/pages/data-science-career-specializations) that i´ve been learning with until today. 


<!-- Beside that i acquired Data Science and Machine Learning books of which my favorite is [The StatQuest Illustrated Guide To Machine Learning](https://www.amazon.de/StatQuest-Illustrated-Guide-Machine-Learning/dp/B0BLM4TLPY/ref=sr_1_1?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=1DZ984LPZBRUR&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.2GXCz4jRDRokvgYbH-yB2ixMfIjFE0fH1PcNOqB1bF0fJO7njNeqbo6MkCqF3QCnVepK43ktQ4hbYsot9k76Mqi5pabA9c2XLbi00EbkT-RD5YLt6kXab6-a4aBqI58g5o5WGklCQBROMuYfsDPz3CAfSfzAfpG6cGFKmmi3mqHjOqYK3yqZpnWfTQdmO_QjE6Fv5jc0HGO81mzta6OrmPLjTIdlfbg1cmWxZ9YWy_8.0u7oSjrPegoloBmJhhIl4uBUDHJyC3Q7VyCNc8ozCUA&dib_tag=se&keywords=stat+quest&qid=1730454982&sprefix=stat+quest%2Caps%2C111&sr=8-1) by Josh Starmer (check out his genius [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@statquest) Channel!). -->

And here I am! I have a big motivation to dive depper into the world of Data Science and Machine Learning.
