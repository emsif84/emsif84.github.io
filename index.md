# Working Experience
## Projects in my current position

* Currently creating dashbords with PowerBI about customer data and residential assets.
To reach this goal I extracted and transformed data with SQL in Snowflake and connected Snowflake with PowerBI to update the data daily. I use DAX to create measures to display KPIs and to show trends on a quartely basis.

* Call Analysis and Dashboard with Python and Excel. To reached this goal, csv files were monthly loaded, joined and transformed in Python. With Excel Power Query I loaded the data and then plotted them with a Dashboard.

# Motivation

When i studied Economic Psychology, quantitative methods played a crucial role. I was fascinated gaining insights with data and link them with previous experiences and theories. And somehow i had a sense for handling data. In my 5th semester we conducted a field study among german carsharer. Our partner was Fraunhofer Institute for System and Innovation Research (ISI). And this was my start in Energy Research. Afterwards I wrote my thesis at Fraunhofer ISI, then worked for a few months as a trainee at the Institute for Ressource Effiency and Energy Strategies (IREES) and started there as a Junior Social Scientist. Until this time my study mainly focused on qualitative research. Interviews, Focus Groups, transcribing, analyzing and project meetings were my daily work. But i also did exploratory data analysis, mainly with SPSS and Excel.
