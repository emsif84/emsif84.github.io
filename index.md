# Working Experience
## Projects in my current position

* Currently creating dashbords with PowerBI about customer data and residential assets.
To reach this goal I extracted and transformed data with SQL in Snowflake and connected Snowflake with PowerBI to update the data daily. I use DAX to create measures to display KPIs and to show trends on a quartely basis.

* Call Analysis and Dashboard with Python and Excel. To reached this goal, csv files were monthly loaded, joined and transformed in Python. With Excel Power Query I loaded the data and then plotted them with a Dashboard.

# Motivation

When I studied Economic Psychology, quantitative methods played a crucial role in the curriculum. I was exited about gaining insights with data. And somehow i had a sense for handling data. In my 5th semester we conducted a quantitative field study among carsharer. Our partner was Fraunhofer Institute for System and Innovation Research. And this was my start in Energy Research. I wrote my thesis there, then worked for a few months as a trainee at the Institute for Ressource Efficiency and Energy Strategies and lastly started there as a Junior Social Scientist. Until this time my study mainly focused on qualitative research. Interviews, Focus Groups, transcribing, analyzing and project meetings were my daily work. But i also did exploratory data analysis, mainly with SPSS and Excel.

When I jumped into the Telecom Industry i quickly realised that handling data require different skills. And thereÂ´s a simple reason for that. Data is alive. During my research time i worked with static data derived from surveys. But now I have to work with dynamic data that changes daily.
